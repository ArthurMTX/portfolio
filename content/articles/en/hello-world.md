# Hello

This site is my personal workspace on the web.

Not a landing page. Not a product. Not a social profile.

Just a place to document what I build, what I break, and what I learn along the way.

## Why a personal site?

Most of what we publish today lives on platforms we don’t control.

Algorithms decide what is visible. Formats change. Accounts disappear.

A personal website is slower, quieter, but stable.  
It’s something you own. You can change it, break it, rebuild it, or leave it untouched for years.

That matters more than it sounds.

## What you’ll find here

Two main things:

- **Projects** — things I’m building or experimenting with  
- **Notes** — short articles about technical problems, design decisions, tools, and occasional thoughts

This is not meant to be polished or optimized for clicks. Some posts will be messy. Some will be very specific. That’s fine.

I mostly write in Markdown because it’s simple and durable. No tooling ceremony, just text.

## Stack (for context)

- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Markdown files (for posts & projects)

Nothing exotic. Just tools that stay out of the way.

## Why write at all?

Writing forces clarity.

If I can’t explain something simply, I probably don’t understand it well enough yet.  
This blog is partly for others, but mostly for future me.

## That’s it

This site will evolve slowly, like most things worth keeping.

If you find something useful here, cool.  
If not, that’s fine too.
